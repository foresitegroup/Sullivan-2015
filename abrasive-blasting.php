Abrasive blasting is the operation of cleaning or preparing a surface by forcibly propelling a stream of abrasive material against it under high pressure. Usually explained as the use of a material against another material to make it smoother, remove surface contaminants or to roughen a surface. There are several variants of the process, such as bead blasting, sandblasting, shot blasting.<br>
<br>

Shot blasting is also used for removing burrs, scale, and rust that may interfere with the part's integrity, appearance, or definition. Shot blasting can also prepare the surface of a part for coating by removing surface contaminants and provide a surface profile for increased coating adhesion.<br>

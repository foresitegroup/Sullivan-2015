<h3>STRESS RELIEVING SERVICES</h3>

<div class="half-left">
  Thermal Stress Relieving is an annealing process that heats the metal below the austenite phase to reduce distortions or changes in dimensions that might occur after shaping.<br>
  <br>

  Stress relieving will reduce distortion and high stresses from flame cutting, machining, welding and other processes that can affect additional manufacturing procedures.<br>
  <br>

  Various manufacturing processes such as forming, machining, grinding, heating, and plating leave their characteristic residual stress pattern implanted in the steel. These residual stresses can lead to undesirable dimensional changes, during the production process.<br>
  <br>

  Stress relieving, or stress-relief anneal, is done to low carbon grades, in order to remove stresses that have built up in the part from flame-cutting or from mechanical flattening.<br>
  <br>

  This is important when the parts will go on to be ground, machined, or fabricated. Without stress relieving, parts may develop bow or twist as they are further processed.<br>
  <br>

  Stress relieving consists of heating the parts to a temperature just below the range at which the grain structure begins to change, usually 1100° to 1200°F. The parts are held at this temperature long enough to achieve a uniform temperature throughout. Then they are allowed to cool in the furnace. Generally, no grain transformation takes place in stress relieving.<br>

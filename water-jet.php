<h3>WATER JET SERVICES</h3>

Water jet cutting is one of the most versatile cutting processes around. Well suited for high-performance metal cutting, water jet technology, when used with an abrasive additive, creates a clean, burr-free cut that does not require secondary finishing and does not leave a heat-affected zone. Nearly every type of cut is possible, from rapid hole drilling to detailed cuts for automotive applications.<br>

<h3>GRINDING SERVICES</h3>

<div class="half-left">
  Sullivan Corporation has a grinder to meet almost every need. Grinding is where we have made our name and we continue to expand on our services to meet the diverse needs of our customers and an ever-changing economy.<br>
  <br>

  Blanchard Grinding, technically referred to as Rotary Surface Grinding, quickly removes stock from one side of a part. Abrasive stones are used to remove stock from the work-piece. Magnetic materials are held in place with an electromagnetic chuck. Dimensional tolerances of approximately 0.001" parallelism and flatness per foot of diagonal of part are achievable on Blanchard Grinders. Surface finish typically will run 63 micro-inch RMS and as high as 32 micro-inch RMS with certain material. Using significantly greater horsepower than other grinding methods, Blanchard Grinding removes large amounts of stock quickly and efficiently. Non-ferrous materials can also be ground, but require special work holding arrangements.<br>
  <br>

  Ideal for large parts such as rotary tables, side plates, weldments, fabrications, forgings and machine bases, Blanchard Grinding adds size versatility, improved surface conditions, eliminates mismatches, and speeds turnaround time on large parts when compared to milling. This method provides a considerable time savings over surface grinding as well.<br>
  <br>

  Pre-machining costs and turnaround time can be reduced by simultaneously Blanchard Grinding multiple parts.<br>
  <br>

  The Blanchard grinding process will leave its trademark cross-hatched surface finish pattern, typically within a 32 - 125 RMS range, though higher finishes are possible.<br>

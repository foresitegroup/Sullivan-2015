Both oxy-fuel and plasma arc cutting utilize computer numerically controlled (CNC) systems for the highest degree of accuracy. If necessary, we can manually program machines using your blueprints or drawings; but direct file transfer via DXF enables us to bypass that step, which ensures greater accuracy in programming and reduces turnaround time for virtually every job.
